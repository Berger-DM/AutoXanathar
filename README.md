# AutoXanathar

AutoXanathar is a Python 3 script to automatically generate character stories from the contents of the tables present in the "This is Your Life" section of Xanathar's Guide to Everything, a supplement book to the 5th Edition of the Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game.

It takes as input:
- Character Race
- Character Background
- Character Class
- CHA mod

And delivers as output a .txt file with a whole randomly generated character story based on the inputs in the same directory as the script (or executable) is located.
